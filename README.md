This code facilitates comparing the draft Minneapolis 2040 Comprehensive Plan's
Built Form Map against historical redlining maps from the Home Owners' Loan
Corporation (HOLC).

Map data was obtained from
[Minneapolis 2040](https://minneapolis2040.com/topics/land-use-built-form/)
and from
[Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#city=minneapolis-mn");

The combined map is posted on S3 at [https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/divergentdave-geojson/map.html].
